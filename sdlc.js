// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which you sit down and think about all of the small things that will fit together to accomplish the goal."

const design = "This is the third step in which the user experience is decided upon and what, for example, the website will look like."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step which you canno start until the first three steps have been completed. Coding is done here"

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which we hand off our work to someone whose job it is to try to break it. Once it cannot be broken, the product is passed on to production."

const maintain = "This is the final, never ending step. A piece of code is never finished and will always need to be maintained."
